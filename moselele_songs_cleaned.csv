[C] The sirens are screaming and the [F] fires are howling, way [C] down in the valley tonight.
There’s a man in the shadows [Em]with a gun in his eye,
And a [F] blade shining, oh, so bright. There’s [C] evil in the air and there’s [G] thunder in the sky,
And a [Am] killer’s on the bloodshot [F] streets. [F]
Oh, and [C] down in the tunnel where the [G] deadly are rising,
Oh, I [Dm] swear I saw a young boy, Down in the gutter,

But I [F] gotta get out, I gotta [G] break it out now, Be[Am]fore the final crack of [F] dawn. [F]
So we [C] gotta make the most of our [G] one night together,
When it’s [F] over, you know, we’ll both be so alone. [G] – [F/G] [G] – [F/G]

Like a [C]bat out of hell, I’ll [F] be gone when the morning [C] comes. When the [C] night is over,
Like [Em] a bat out of hell [F] I’ll be [Am7] gone, [Dm]gone, gone.
Like a [C] bat out of hell I’ll [G] be gone when the morning [F] comes.
But when the [C] day is done, and the[G] sun goes down,

I’m [C] gonna hit the highway [F] like a battering ram, on a [C] silver black phantom bike,
When the [C]metal is hot and [Em] the engine is hungry, and we’re [F] all about to see the light.
[C]Nothing ever grows in [G] this rotten old hole, [Am] everything is stunted and [F] lost.
And [C]nothing really rocks, and [G] nothing really rolls, and [F]nothing’s ever [G]worth the [C] cost.

And I [F] know that I’m [G] damned  if I [C] never get out, and [F] maybe I’m [G] damned if I [C] do,
But with [F] every other [G] beat I got [Am] left in my heart,
You know I’d [F] rather [G] be damned with [C] you.
Well, if I [C] gotta be damned, you know [G] I wanna be damned,
[F]Dancing through the [G] night with [C] you.
If I [C] gotta be damned, you know  I [G] wanna be damned,
[C] Gotta be damned, you know, I [F] wanna be damned,

On the first part [Em] of the journey, [D6]
I was [Em] looking at all the [D6] life
There were [Em] plants and birds and rocks [D6] and things,
There [Em] was sand and hills [D6] and rings.
The first [Em] thing I met, was a fly with [D6] a buzz,
And [Em] the sky, with no [D6] clouds
The heat [Em] was hot, and the ground [D6] was dry,
But the [Em] air was full of [D6] sound.

I've [Em] been through the desert on a [D6add9] horse with no name,
It felt [Em] good to be out of the [D6add9] rain

Made me [Em] sad to think it was [D6] dead.

'Cause the [Em] desert had turned to [D6] sea
There were [Em] plants and birds, and [D6] rocks and things,
There was [Em] sand and hills and [D6] rings.
The [Em] ocean is a desert, with it's [D6] life underground,
And a [Em] perfect disguise [D6] above
[Em] Under the cities lies a [D6] heart made of ground
But the [Em] humans will give no [D6] love.

[G]//// [G]//// [G]//// [G]////
[G] A mile and a half on a bus takes a long time
[G]The odour of old prison food takes a long time to
[C] pass you by [C]////
[G]Day upon day of this wandering gets you down
[G]Nobody gives you a chance or a dollar in
[C] this old town [C]////

[G] Hovering silence from you is a giveaway
[G]Squalor and smoke’s not your style, “I don’t like this place”
[C]We better go [C]////
[G]Then I compare notes with your older sister
[G]I am a lazy gett, she is as pure as the
[C] cold driven snow [C]////

[G] What did you learn from your time in the solitary cell of your mind?
[G]There was noises, distractions from
[C]anything good [C]And the old prison food
[G]Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
[G]Cause anything’s better than posh isolation
[C] I missed the bus, you were laid on your back

And I've been [Eb] dangling in limbo, barely keeping my cool.
It's like I'm [Bb] snookered 'tween the back cushion and touching the eight ball.
Keep [Eb] replaying my turn until your patience is shot.
You peel your [Bb] white gloves off seductively before you respot.

And while she [D7] tried to be a star

Across the [Cdim] crow-[D7]-ded [Gm] floor

He was [D7] escorted to his chair
He saw [Gm7] Lola dancing there
And when she [Fm7] finished
He called her [Ebmaj7] over
But Rico [D7] went a bit too far
Tony [Gm7] sailed across the bar

And then [Cdim] the pun-[D7]-ches [Gm] flew
And chairs were [Cdim] smashed [D7] in [Gm] two

We had [C*] five years left to cry in

[Em*] Earth was really dying
[A*] Cried so much, his face was wet
Then I [C*] knew he was not lying.

I heard [G] telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw [Em] boys, toys, electric irons and T.V's

[A] If the black had not pulled her off,
I [C] think she would have killed them

[G] A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his
[Em] stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
[A] A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a [C] queer threw up at the sight of that.

[G] I think I saw you in an ice cream parlour
[Em] Drinking milkshakes cold and long
[A] Smiling and waving and looking so fine
[C] Don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was [G] cold, and it rained, so i felt like an actor and I
[Em] thought of Ma, and I wanted to get back there
Your [A] face, Your race, the way that you talk
I [C] kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk.

And though I'm nobody's [F] poet, I thought it wasn't half [C] bad.
Yes, I like piña [F] coladas and getting caught in the [C] rain
I'm not much into [F] health food, I am into champ-[C]-agne

At a bar called [F] O'Malley's where we'll plan our [C] escape [*]

Then we laughed for a [F] moment and I said, ""I [C] never knew.""

All this [Cmaj7] time she was [Bbmaj7] standing there
She [Cmaj7] never took her eyes off [Bbmaj7] me
How you can [Cmaj7] grant the woman access to your [Bbmaj7] villa
Trespasser and a [Cmaj7] witness while you cling to your [Bbmaj7] pillow

Never ad-[Cmaj7] -mit to a word when she [Bbmaj7] say
And if she claims and [Cmaj7] you tell her baby no [Bbmaj7] way

Make sure she knows it's [Cmaj7] not you and lead her on the right [Bbmaj7] prefix
Whenever you should [Cmaj7] see her make the gigolo [Bbmaj7] flex
As funny as it [Cmaj7] be by you, it not that [Bbmaj7] complex
Seeing is bel-[Cmaj7]-ieving so you better change your [Bbmaj7] specs
You know she not gonna [Cmaj7] be worrying 'bout things from the [Bbmaj7] past
Hardly recoll-[Cmaj7]-ecting and then she'll go to noontime [Bbmaj7] mass
